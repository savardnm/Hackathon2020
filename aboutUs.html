    <h1>What is This?</h1>

    <div class = "blockText">    <p>Imagine you're a chemical engineering major, trying to figure out how to
        make a distillation column at the end of B Term your sophomore year but
        your group has nowhere to go because Foisie is full (and faculty tried
        steal it from you anyways so whatever) and the library is full and
        you have one hour until your next class but you spent half of it
        trying to find somewhere with an outlet to sit down because your laptop
        battery has died completely and life is just really hard right now
        and you spent an hour crying on the phone to your mom last night
        but you're still out here doing your best but it's not your best
        because your computer is dead and every study space is full.
        Now imagine hecking the system and studying in empty classrooms
        between class  where there are outlets and quiet space and not
        your private hell. </p></div>
