    <h1>What is This?</h1>

    <p>Imagine you're a chemical engineering major, trying to figure out how to <br>
        make a distillation column at the end of B Term your sophomore year but <br>
        your group has nowhere to go because Foisie is full (and faculty tried <br>
        steal it from you anyways so whatever) and the library is full and <br>
        you have one hour until your next class but you spent half of it <br>
        trying to find somewhere with an outlet to sit down because your laptop <br>
        battery has died completely and life is just really hard right now <br>
        and you spent an hour crying on the phone to your mom last night <br>
        but you're still out here doing your best but it's not your best <br>
        because your computer is dead and every study space is full. <br>
        Now imagine hecking the system and studying in empty classrooms <br>
        between class  where there are outlets and quiet space and not <br>
        your private hell. </p>

        loveable family friendly WPI students come in! <br>
        We made this app during 2020 Hackathon for you!</p>
